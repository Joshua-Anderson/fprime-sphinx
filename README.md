# fprime-sphinx

In this repository, you will find the App directory which contains the Sphinx Reference  
deployment. The deployment runs on the Sphinx and demonstrates capabilities such as  
commanding software, and receiving telemetry -- to name a few.

You will also find links to other software repositories, such as a link to the software  
interface for the Sphinx hardware. These links are needed to fully build the Sphinx  
Reference deployment. More information in the *Submodule Repositories* section below.

# Sphinx Reference Deployment
App is a F´ deployment that utilizes many of the Sphinx peripherals.
The reference deployment is meant to be a starting point for users
wanting to use the Sphinx hardware. For more information on the App
deployment, please read [`App`](./App/README.md)

# Submodule Repositories

`fprime-vxworks` provides an OS abstraction layer to vxworks.  
`fprime-sphinx-drivers` provides drivers for the Sphinx such as UART, SPI, GPIO drivers, and so on.  
`fprime` provides the core F´ FSW framework.
